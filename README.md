# symnav

A CLI for navigating TypeScript codebases by symbol.

## Development

Install dependencies and build the workspace before running tests; e2e tests exercise the built binary, not source.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

To run the CLI from source during development, use the `dev` script in `apps/cli`:

```sh
pnpm --filter symnav dev --version
```
